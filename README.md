# Breast Cancer Detection with Decision Tree

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to classify breast cancer tumors based on various features such as texture, smoothness, area, etc. The Decision Tree model is trained on the dataset to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset, which is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module. The dataset contains features derived from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies.

- **Malignant** tumors are labeled as `1`.
- **Benign** tumors are labeled as `0`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


## How to Use

git clone https://github.com/Nasim-Khalili/breast-cancer-detection.git
cd breast-cancer-detection
python breast_cancer_detection.py
```
